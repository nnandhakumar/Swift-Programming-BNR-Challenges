## **Objective**: 
To catalog all the challenges in the book, and 
attempt to implement my own solutions. I wish to leverage the help of others, and any contributions regarding how to better execute some of these challenges will be very welcomed

## Tools:
These challenges should work for Xcode 7.1

### Challenge 1:
Add a new string variable having your last name and print it to the console. Add a new variable to the playground representing Nowhereâ€™s level of unemployment. Give the variable a value and update townDescription to use the new information.
