## **Objective**: 
To catalog all the challenges in the book, and 
attempt to implement my own solutions. I wish to leverage the help of others, and any contributions regarding how to better execute some of these challenges will be very welcomed

## Tools:
These challenges should work for Xcode 7.1

### Challenge 1: Getting Started
Add a new string variable having your last name and print it to the console. Add a new variable to the playground representing Nowhereâ€™s level of unemployment. Give the variable a value and update townDescription to use the new information.

### Challenge 2: Types, Constants, and Variables
Add a new variable representing Knowhere's level of unemployment. Give this variable a value, and update townDescription to use the new information.

### Challenge 3: Conditional
Add an additional else if statement to the town sizing code to see if your town's population is very large/ Choose your own population thresholds. Set the message variable accordingly.

### Challenge 4: Numbers
What is the binary representation of -1 using an 8-bit signed integer?
If that same bit pattern is interpretated as an 8-bit unsigned integer, what
would the value be?

### Challenge 5: Switch
Challenge is to review the switch statement below, and evaluate what will be logged to the console.

### Challenge 6: Loops
Use a loop to count by 2 from 0 up to 100. Use another loop to make sure the first loop is run 5 times. Hint: One good way to do this is to use a nested loop.
