# Swift-Programming-BNR-Challenges
My implementations of the challenges at the end of The Big Nerd Ranch Swift Programming chapters

Objectice: To catalog all the challenges in the book, and 
attempt to implement my own solutions. I wish to leverage the help of others, and any contributions regarding how to better execute some of these challenges will be very welcomed

Tools: These challenges should work for Xcode <7 class="1"></7>
